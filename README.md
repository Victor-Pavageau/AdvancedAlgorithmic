## About

This project is a Python implementation of an optimization algorithm designed to solve a delivery route planning problem, inspired by the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The algorithm aims to calculate the most optimal delivery route on a road network, connecting a subset of cities and returning to the starting point while minimizing the total travel time. The solution accounts for traffic variations during different time slots, enhancing its practicality for real-world applications. The implementation was developed in Python using Jupyter Notebook, leveraging concepts from Operational Research and advanced algorithmic complexity.

This project was undertaken during my first year of engineering studies (Bac+3 in the French education system) as part of a school assignment, providing valuable hands-on experience in algorithm design, problem-solving, and collaboration within a team of three.
